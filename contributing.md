## Working on new features

The projects section contains a general overview of components needed for this application to work. They may be in various stages of completeness, but the general rule is, if you are interested working on a certain feature area, or feel you can improve another feature area. convey this to me, we can get you on board and you can start weaving your magic.

Features for the project can be in one of [four stages](https://github.com/dweng0/wildflower/projects/1):

### TODO
> A feature identified as something that is needed in order to complete the bigger picture.

These features have not been started but.

### Discussion
> Currently ironing out the finer details.

Features in discussion are having their scopes set out and their requirements buffed into shiny stamps of approval.
It is at this stage that open source alternatives can be explored and tested to see if they meet the requirements.

### I've commitment issues...
In order to maintain... Order... and to keep the experience lovely for everyone, there are three ground rules:
